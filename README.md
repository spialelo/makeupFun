Fun with my makeup bag - [Will think of a different name, once I get closer to finishing it]

20151006 - User inputs makeup and it is stored as an object. Next step to push each object, into the "bag".

20151007 - Can add to my makeup bag and then display contents. Even give a bit of feedback of what is in the bag. 

2017010307 - Started 100 Days of code Challenge. Will copy work from here to that repo also. Think of it as a backup.
**Today's Progress**: Built out the remaining methods for my searchAll object.
**Thoughts** Method searchByName. There is room for improvement there. Split the input based on whitespace and see if any of the substrings of the input match the value stored in the makeup name property at the index in the loop.
