Fun with my makeup bag - [Will think of a different name, once I get closer to finishing it]

Added a clear display button & function, plus tweaked the reset button function a tiny bit. **Thoughts** Taking a break from Hacker Rank and going back to Code Wars until I do more research into Hacker Rank's reading of input.
